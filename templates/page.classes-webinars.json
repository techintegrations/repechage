It hardens as it cools, which allows it to be removed without strips. It’s known for being gentle on the skin and is ideal for coarse or short hair, as it adheres to the hair more than to the skin, reducing irritation.</li><li>SeaSmooth Artisan Seaweed Wax®: This wax is used with strips and is ideal for larger areas like the legs or arms. It is more efficient for removing fine to medium hair. Soft wax adheres to both the hair and the Skin, making it more effective at removing hair without irritation if not used carefully.
