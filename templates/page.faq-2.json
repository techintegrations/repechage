Repêchage has worked with leading scientists and aquaculturists to sustainably harvest several species of nutrient-rich seaweed.2.What makes Repêchage seaweed different from the seaweed in other skincare lines?Most manufacturers of seaweed-based products use the oven drying method of processing. This method yields a product, which contains trace elements but may be deficient in vitamins and amino acids that are heat sensitive. This is where Repêchage makes all the difference. Once dried, the seaweed is packed and sent to our ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility. There, by an exclusive proprietary method, Repêchage chemists expel the intercellular fluid from the fibrous seaweed tissue while retaining the activity of the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and amino acids, processed into the pure filtrate in small artisanal batches. You know when it’s a filtrate day---the whole facility smells like a day at the beach!3.Is Repêchage seaweed sourced from sustainable sources?Yes. Repêchage uses sustainably harvested seaweed from the Brittany Coast of France and coast of Maine, USA.<\/p>"
