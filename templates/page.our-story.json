And if it can hydrate the desert, imagine what it can do for your skin!<\/p><p>Want your skin to look <strong>glowing<\/strong>? You can credit the use of seaweed with <strong>increased hydration<\/strong> and <strong>improves the complexion<\/strong>. Scientists believe that seaweed produces over 70% of the the earth's oxygen.<\/p><p>Seaweed feeds itself through osmosis by absorbing minerals and vitamins from the seawater. By an exclusive proprietary method, Repêchage chemists expel the intercellular fluid from the fibrous seaweed tissue while retaining the activity of the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and amino acids.<\/p><p>Researchers point out the almost uncanny similarity between seawater and human plasma, our intercellular fluid.  The sea covers over two-thirds of our planet, and, perhaps as no coincidence, the human body is made of two-thirds water as well.<\/p>",

What inspired me to call my company Repêchage were the reactions of those who first experienced the Four Layer Facial®. The results were amazing. Everyone said \"Wow! My skin has never felt so wonderful! It's like being reborn!\" But its original meaning came from fishermen trying once more to make a catch by casting out their nets again, to literally \"re-fish\" or \"re-pesce,\" so the connection to seaweed and the sea was perfect.

For wild harvesting the harvest takes place early in the morning, during the lowest tides of the spring and summer months that accompany the new and full moons.<\/p><p>Or, seaweed can be grown on ropes suspended in seawater, harvested by boat along floating lines and gathered into nets or large storage bins on harvesting boats. Crops are harvested over a period of a month or two until temperature conditions limit the growth of the crop.

This method yields a product, which contains trace elements but may be deficient in vitamins and amino acids that are heat sensitive.This is where Repêchage makes all the difference. Once dried, the seaweed is packed and sent to our ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility. There, by an exclusive proprietary method, Repêchage chemists expel the intercellular fluid from the fibrous seaweed tissue while retaining the activity of the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and amino acids, processed into the pure filtrate in small artisanal batches. You know when it’s a filtrate day---the whole facility smells like a day at the beach!<\/p><p>This filtrate is then properly refrigerated and stored for six months to allow the liquid to reach its full potency. Then, it is incorporated into the Repêchage products until the next harvest arrives. Nothing is purer or more effective at helping skin look and feel smoother and softer.<\/p>",
