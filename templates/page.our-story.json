And if it can hydrate the desert, imagine what it can do for your skin!<\/p><p>Want your skin to look <strong>glowing<\/strong>? You can credit the use of seaweed with <strong>increased hydration<\/strong> and <strong>improves the complexion<\/strong>. Scientists believe that seaweed produces over 70% of the the earth's oxygen.<\/p><p>Seaweed feeds itself through osmosis by absorbing minerals and vitamins from the seawater. By an exclusive proprietary method, Repêchage chemists expel the intercellular fluid from the fibrous seaweed tissue while retaining the activity of the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and amino acids.<\/p><p>Researchers point out the almost uncanny similarity between seawater and human plasma, our intercellular fluid.  The sea covers over two-thirds of our planet, and, perhaps as no coincidence, the human body is made of two-thirds water as well.<\/p>",

What inspired me to call my company Repêchage were the reactions of those who first experienced the Four Layer Facial®. The results were amazing. Everyone said \"Wow! My skin has never felt so wonderful! It's like being reborn!\" But its original meaning came from fishermen trying once more to make a catch by casting out their nets again, to literally \"re-fish\" or \"re-pesce,\" so the connection to seaweed and the sea was perfect. To me, it means that anyone that has struggled to have great skin can have a Repêchage, a second chance.<\/p>",
