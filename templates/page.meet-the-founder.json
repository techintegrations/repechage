After receiving a cosmetology license, she began her first job as a makeup formulator and creator, blending cosmetics on Madison Ave. After working as a lead esthetician in one of the top NYC spas, she ventured out on her own, opening her first spa in 1977 on 53rd Street and Madison Ave. She quickly became the \"it\" skin care expert to the social set and celebrities. She introduced the Four-Layer Facial in 1980, an entirely new concept in uni-dose facial applications born from the need to assure consistent, 100% efficacy, satisfaction and cleanliness for each client. This facial, based on layer upon layer of freshly harvested seaweed extract (<a href=\"\/products\/c-serum-seaweed-filtrate-face-serum-new-size\" title=\"\/products\/c-serum-seaweed-filtrate-face-serum-new-size\">including our best-selling C-Serum<\/a>) and a thermal mineral lift off mask, proved to be the treatment that would change professional skin care forever.<\/p>",
