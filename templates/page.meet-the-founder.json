As a young girl, she was an avid student of the sciences, especially chemistry and biology, as well as of the arts, in particular literature. This was the beginning of her life's passion of combining her creative energies with her thirst for scientific knowledge. She has found that knowing how and why things worked has been the driving force behind creating and formulating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repechage.com\/collections\/best-and-new\" title=\"https:\/\/www.repechage.com\/collections\/best-and-new\">new products<\/a>.<\/p>",

After receiving a cosmetology license, she began her first job as a makeup formulator and creator, blending cosmetics on Madison Ave. After working as a lead esthetician in one of the top NYC spas, she ventured out on her own, opening her first spa in 1977 on 53rd Street and Madison Ave. She quickly became the \"it\" skin care expert to the social set and celebrities. She introduced the Four Layer Facial in 1980, an entirely new concept in uni-dose facial applications born from the need to assure consistent, 100% efficacy, satisfaction and cleanliness for each client. This facial, based on layer upon layer of freshly harvested seaweed extract (<a href=\"\/products\/c-serum-seaweed-filtrate-face-serum-new-size\" title=\"\/products\/c-serum-seaweed-filtrate-face-serum-new-size\">including our best-selling C-Serum<\/a>) and a thermal mineral lift off mask, proved to be the treatment that would change professional skin care forever.<\/p>",
